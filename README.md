# Nutritional-Needs

Vitamins and nutrients are an important part of our health. There are genetic markers associated with being predisposed to lower levels of certain nutrients, which means you may want to make certain your diet has enough of the foods that contain these nutrients.

## Vitmain B2

Vitamin B2, or riboflavin, is a central component of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), both of which serve as cofactors of several critical enzymes involved in the electron transport chain, as well as in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats and proteins41. Vitamin B2 is found in a variety of foods including milk, cheese, green leafy vegetables, legumes, beans, lean meats and fortified grains.

Individuals with the A/A genotype at a variant in the MTHFR gene are likely to have increased levels of homocysteine, which are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke. Levels of homocysteine were highest in A/A individuals with low riboflavin or vitamin B2 levels, and further, riboflavin supplementation was found to reduce homocysteine levels in these individuals.

## Vitamin B6

Vitamin B6, also called pyridoxine, helps your body's neurological system to function properly, promotes red blood cell health, and is involved in sugar metabolism. Vitamin B6 is found naturally in many foods, including beans, whole grains, meat, eggs and fish. Most people receive sufficient amounts of vitamin B6 from a healthy diet, and B6 deficiency is rare in the United States.

The genetic marker rs4654748 in the NBPF3 gene (near the ALPL gene) has been found in multiple studies to be associated with reduced levels of vitamin B6, possibly due to faster than normal clearance of this vitamin from the bloodstream. Individuals with a C/C or C/T genotype had lower levels of B6 than those with the T/T genotype.

These studies observed associations between vitamin levels and particular genotypes; however, that does not mean that your levels are out of balance. You should ensure that you are eating a healthy diet and discuss this result with your physician. The recommended intake of vitamin B6 for most adults is 1.3 to 1.7 milligrams per day.

## Vitamin B12

Vitamin B12 plays an important role in how your brain and nervous system function. It helps to keep red blood cells healthy and is a critical component for synthesis and regulation of your DNA49. Vitamin B12 is found naturally in foods of animal origin including meat, fish, poultry, eggs and milk products. A healthy diet will typically provide sufficient B12, although vegetarians, vegans, older people, and those with problems absorbing B12 due to digestive system disorders may be deficient. Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can vary, but may include fatigue, weakness, bloating, or numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. The recommended intake for adults is 2.4 micrograms per day.

Multiple genetic studies have identified a marker in the gene FUT2 as being associated with lower levels of B12 in the blood. This effect may be due to reduced absorption of B12 in the gut. People with G/G or A/G genotypes may have lower levels of B12. Eating foods rich in vitamin B12 can promote healthy levels of B12, especially for those over the age of 50. These studies observed associations between vitamin B12 levels and particular genotypes; however, that does not mean that your levels are out of balance. You should ensure that you are eating a healthy diet and discuss this result with your physician.

## Folate - Folic Acid

Folate is found in many foods, such as green leafy vegetables like chard or kale, as well as beans, lentils, fruits and fortified grains. This nutrient plays a role in protein metabolism, as well as DNA repair. Folate can lower the blood level of homocysteine, a substance linked to cardiovascular disease at high levels. Diets rich in folate have been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.

Folate is particularly important early in pregnancy for preventing some birth defects. For this reason, pregnant women or women intending to become pregnant are advised an elevated recommended daily intake of 600 micrograms of folate. The recommended intake of folate for most adults is 400 micrograms per day.

A relatively common variant in the MTHFR gene, known as C677T (rs1801133), has been associated with lowered folate and elevated homocysteine levels in the blood. These studies observed associations between vitamin levels and particular genotypes; however, that does not mean that your levels are out of balance. You should ensure that you are eating a healthy diet and discuss this result with your physician.

Strength of study: 3/4

## Vitamin A

Vitamin A is a nutrient that describes a number of related compounds, including retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid. Vitamin A is critical for numerous functions in the body, including healthy vision, immune system action, bone growth, reproduction, and the proper regulation of gene expression. The recommended intake of vitamin A for most adults is 700 to 900 micrograms per day.

Much of the vitamin A found in your body is derived from beta-carotene, a nutrient found in some plants and foods, such as pumpkin, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach. A genetic study has found that vitamin A conversion from beta-carotene is impaired in women carrying variants of the BCMO1 gene. This association has not been studied in men. These studies observed associations between vitamin A levels and particular genotypes. However, that does not mean that your levels are out of balance. You should eat a healthy diet and speak with your physician before making specific changes to your dietary regimen.

## Vitamin C

Vitamin C, or L-ascorbic acid, must be acquired from dietary sources, as humans are unable to synthesize it. Some dietary sources of vitamin C include lemons, oranges, red peppers, watermelons, strawberries and citrus juices or juices fortified with vitamin C. While a severe deficiency of vitamin C ultimately leads to scurvy, variations in vitamin C levels have also been associated with a wide range of chronic complex diseases, such as atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes and cancer.

These associations are thought to result from a contribution of vitamin C as an antioxidant, as well as its role in the synthesis of collagen and various hormones. After ingestion, the vitamin C in one's diet gets transported across the cell membrane via transport proteins, one of which is SLC23A1. A recent study of over 15,000 people found that the T allele of a variant in SLC23A1 was associated with decreased levels of circulating vitamin C.

## Vitamin D

Vitamin D is important for the absorption and utilization of calcium, which is beneficial for maintaining good bone health. Exposure to sunlight is an important determinant of a person's vitamin D level, since there are few natural dietary sources of vitamin D. While sunscreen use blocks skin production of vitamin D, excessive sun exposure is a risk factor for skin cancer and related conditions, and is not recommended. Dietary sources of vitamin D include some fatty fish, fish liver oils, and milk or cereals fortified with vitamin D. The recommended intake of vitamin D for most adults is 600 IUs per day. About 115 IUs of vitamin D is found in one cup of vitamin D-fortified, non-fat, fluid milk.

Multiple genetic studies have identified a variant in the GC gene that codes for the vitamin D-binding protein that is associated with decreased blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which is the major circulating form of vitamin D. People with the G/G or G/T genotype at this genetic marker may be susceptible to lower blood vitamin D levels due to reduced ability to transport vitamin D in the body. These studies we report observed associations between vitamin D levels and certain genotypes; however, that does not mean that your levels are out of balance. You should eat a healthy diet and speak with your physician before making specific changes to your dietary regimen.

## Vitamin E

Vitamin E is a group of eight antioxidant molecules, of which alpha-tocopherol is the most abundant in the body. Vitamin E functions to promote a strong immune system and regulates other metabolic processes. The recommended intake of vitamin E for most adults is 15 milligrams per day. Note that synthetic varieties of vitamin E found in some fortified foods and supplements are less biologically active. Sources of naturally-occurring vitamin E in foods are vegetable oils, green leafy vegetables, eggs and nuts.

One study of 3,891 individuals found that people with the A/A or A/C genotypes at an intergenic marker, rs12272004, near the APOA5 gene, had increased plasma levels of alpha-tocopherol. This is good news since increased vitamin E levels are associated with decreased frailty and disability in old age. People with the C/C genotype were not associated with increased levels of alpha-tocopherol, and hence they would need to optimize their intake of vitamin E through the increased intake of foods rich in vitamin E. Keep in mind, however, that most adults normally do not take in adequate amounts of vitamin E on a daily basis, so keeping an eye on your vitamin E intake is good advice for anyone. These studies observed associations between vitamin E levels and certain genotypes; however, that does not mean that your levels are out of balance. You should eat a healthy diet and speak with your physician before making specific changes to your dietary regimen.

## Scientific Strength Rating System

The genetic markers and studies selected in this genome app represent the best and most recent genetic research in diet, nutrition, exercise and weight-related health conditions. Some research can be described as stronger than others based on the size of the population studied and whether the outcome has been replicated. Due to the current state of scientific research on the genetics of diet, exercise and nutrition, most of the studies referenced in these results are based on individuals of Caucasian ethnicity. While we all have the same genes, there are genetic and non-genetic factors in different ethnicities that might yield different outcomes for non-Caucasian populations.

Strength of Study:
 * 1/4 : Results in this category should be considered extremely preliminary.
 * 2/4 : Small study of less than 400 people in some cases, with other small replicated studies. Results in this category are preliminary, but pass our criteria for statistical significance.
 * 3/4 : Results derived from a moderately-sized study of at least 400 people, with or without a replication study.
 * 4/4 : Results derived from a large study of approximately 2,000 or more people, with at least one additional study showing the same results (replication study).
